# Pexip Tutorial: Web VPaaS Client

This is an example server for VPaaS. You can run it in development mode through
the following command:

```bash
$ npm start
```

## Configuration file

Modify if needed the configuration file located in `client/public/config.json`:

```json
{
  "server": "http://127.0.0.1:3000"
}
```

## Testing the client

Before testing the client, we will need to run the server and the client in
development mode. Once we have done that, we will be able to access the client
from the URL [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000).
